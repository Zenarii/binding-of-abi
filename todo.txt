Have a map struct with rooms, their links etc.

upon entering a room, load it into current room.
current room != room currently in, so that enemies respawn when you leave and re-enter a room

this allows the easy use of an array of active enemies somewhat seperate from the room itself

some kind of framebuffer approach to be able to draw stuff to their own locations

give enemies behaviour

hit boxes!!
